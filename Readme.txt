Overview
Warehouse Management Survey Robot
Flawless detection of tagged products by automating the process of warehouse management using a robot simulation. Implemented in Python 3, this project reduces the survey time by approximately 60% compared to traditional human-based approaches.

Features
Efficient and automated warehouse survey process.

Product detection via simulation.

Seamless integration with Webots simulation environment.

Technology
Simulation Software: Webots

Programming Language: Python 3

Project Structure
controllers/: Contains all the controller code, including the main script complete.py.

worlds/: Includes the Webots world file Re_edit31.wbt which defines the simulation environment.

Getting Started
Install and open Webots.

Load the world file:
worlds/Re_edit31.wbt

Select the controller script:
controllers/complete.py

Run the simulation to see the robot survey system in action.

Requirements
Webots (latest version recommended)

Python 3

Notes
Ensure the project directory is placed in the correct structure recognized by Webots for seamless simulation execution.
